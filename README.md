# Basic Payment CRUD Application in MERN

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The frontend is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router DOM for client-side routing. Recoil is used for state management. The backend is built using Express and MongoDB as the database, with Mongoose for connecting to the database.

## Frontend

### Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS

2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the frontend application.

### Features

- Client-side routing using React Router DOM
- State management using Recoil
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Backend

### Technologies Used

- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `nodemon index.js` to start the backend server.

### Features

- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Database connection using Mongoose
- Data retrieval and manipulation using Express

## How to Connect Frontend to Backend

1. In the frontend, use the `fetch` function or a library like Axios to make API calls to the backend server.
2. Define API endpoints in the backend using Express.
3. Use Mongoose to connect to the MongoDB database and perform CRUD operations.
